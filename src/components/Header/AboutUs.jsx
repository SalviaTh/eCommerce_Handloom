              Textile handicrafts in Manipur are renowned for their intricate
              designs, vibrant colors, and traditional motifs that reflect the
              state's rich cultural heritage. Weaving is one of the oldest and
              most significant forms of handicraft in Manipur, and it is deeply
              embedded in the daily life and customs of the Manipuri people.
              Women, in particular, have historically been the primary weavers
              in the region, often producing high-quality textiles that are used
              for both everyday wear and ceremonial purposes. Hereâ€™s an overview
              of some prominent textile handicrafts in Manipur:
